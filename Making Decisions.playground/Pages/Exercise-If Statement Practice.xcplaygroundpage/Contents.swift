## Exercise: If Statement Practice
 
 Come to grips with the if statement by rewriting the following comments in code form.
 */
let a = 20
let b = 30
let c = 20

if a == c {
    print("a e c sao iguais")
}

if a < b {
    print("b é maior que a")
}

if b > a {
    print("a não é maior do que b")
}

if a <= c {
    print("a é menor ou igual a c")
}


// If a is equal to c, print "a and c are the same"

// If a is less than b, print "b is ahead of a"

// If b is greater than a, print "a is not winning against b"

// If a is less than or equal to c, print "a is either losing to or tied with c"

/*:
 - callout(Exercise): Add code after each comment above to follow the instructions. (For the greater than and less than operators, remember the rule about the hungry mouth.)
